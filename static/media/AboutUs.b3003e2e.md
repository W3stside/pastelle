## When
Mentally established at the peak of fidget spinners, and legally established in 2022, Pastelle is
headquarted in Lisboa, with Portugal standing firmly as the base of operations for the complete lifecycle
of our streetwear.

## Goal
The goal here is pretty simple. We make, and want to continue to make, high quality apparel that not only
feels solid, but embodies a unique and wholly bespoke feel that sets us apart from the noise. Design
starts here in LX, then production and logistics is handled up North in Porto. Somewhere in between
we're driving up and down to get shirts out and into your hands.

## Notes
Oh and a note on designs - we collab with smaller, local artists and work together to make every design.
We know more than anyone that you're not trying to wear the same shit the next fourteen dudes all
already wore... so we're already built out to integrate NFTs with every purchase. Now you can swag
out and we'll kit you out with the authenticity to boot.
